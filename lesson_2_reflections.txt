Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden directory for tracking purposes. This is necessary in order to 
create commits.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary transfer point between a file being a regular file 
in a directory and being a tracked file in a repository. It allows you to decide 
exactly which files will be tracked in a project.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By moving only the files(s) that contain the changes to the staging area before committing.
