Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with others or working from multiple locations and machines.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because not all remote changes might be good to have in your currently working
version of the code. You get to decide when you want to 'sync'.
